# Anthropic Job Strategy — Tony Arteaga

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Status:** DRAFT — for review & iteration

---

## Profile Summary

- **Location:** Orange County, CA (most Anthropic roles are SF-based — see location note below)
- **Education:** BS Industrial & Systems Engineering (USC) · MBA (USC)
- **Certifications:** Stanford AI Professional Certificate + 3 graduate-level Stanford certs (ML, NLP, Computer Vision) — completed 2024–2025
- **Career arc:** Engineer → Tech/Architecture Leader (Tribune Media, 10 yrs) → Platform VP (Guthy|Renker, 5 yrs) → CRO scaling to $100M+ ARR (OceanX, 7 yrs) → AI/ML deep dive (3 yrs)

---

## The Core Thesis

Tony's story isn't "business guy who took an AI class." It's a **trained engineer** (BS ISE, USC) who spent 20+ years building increasingly cross-functional leadership roles — managing distributed engineering teams, architecting platforms, directing $20M+ projects, and ultimately scaling a company to $100M+ ARR as CRO — then **circled back to deep technical work** with 3 years of Stanford AI/ML coursework and hands-on Python/PyTorch/RAG/agent building. This full-arc profile is precisely what Anthropic needs as it transitions from research lab to enterprise platform company. The strategy should lean *into* the hybrid nature of the profile, not try to fit a single box.

### Location

Tony is based in Orange County but **SF is fine** — willing to relocate. Make this explicit in every application and outreach to remove any filtering. Consider adding "Open to SF relocation" to the resume header.

## Part 1: Target Roles (Apply Directly)

### Tier 1 — Strongest Fit (Apply Immediately)

These roles directly match Tony's blend of GTM leadership, enterprise selling, and AI technical depth.

| # | Role | Team | Why It Fits |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Head of GTM Narrative** | Marketing & Brand | GTM strategy + storytelling at the highest level. Tony's CRO experience means he *is* the GTM narrative. |
| 2 | **Product Marketing Lead, Agents** | Marketing & Brand | Agents are Anthropic's hottest product area. Requires someone who understands the tech AND can position it for enterprise buyers. Tony has built RAG/agent systems *and* sold to C-suite. |
| 3 | **Technical Product Marketing Lead** | Marketing & Brand | The "technical" qualifier filters out most marketing people. Tony's Stanford certs + hands-on AI work make this credible. |
| 4 | **Manager of Solutions Architecture, Applied AI** | Sales | Leading a team that bridges technical AI depth with customer business problems. Tony has built and managed technical teams AND sold at enterprise level. |
| 5 | **Engagement Manager, Applied AI** | Sales | Hybrid strategy + delivery role. Requires understanding customer business problems and translating them into AI solutions. This is essentially what Tony describes as "translating business problems into pilot-ready GenAI workflows." |
| 6 | **Solutions Marketing Lead, Beneficial Deployments** | Marketing & Brand | Positioning AI solutions for real-world impact. Combines Tony's enterprise marketing experience with his AI technical understanding. |

### Tier 2 — Strong Fit (Apply Within 1-2 Weeks)

| # | Role | Team | Why It Fits |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| 7 | **Manager, Account Executive — Enterprise Sales (Industries)** | Sales | Managing an AE team selling into enterprise verticals. Tony has done this at $100M+ scale. |
| 8 | **Sales Manager, Digital Native Business** | Sales | Leading sales into tech-native companies. Tony's B2C & B2B tech background applies. |
| 9 | **Head of Asset & Wealth Management, GTM Sales** | Sales | Vertical GTM leadership. If Tony has any financial services exposure, this is a strong match. |
| 10 | **Head of Insurance, GTM Sales** | Sales | Same as above for insurance vertical. |
| 11 | **Product Operations Manager** | Product Mgmt | Cross-functional operations connecting product, sales, and engineering — Tony's sweet spot. |
| 12 | **Campaign Marketing Manager, Claude Code** | Marketing & Brand | If Tony wants a more execution-focused entry point; his hands-on Claude Code experience would be genuine credibility here. |

### Tier 3 — Stretch / Worth a Conversation

| # | Role | Team | Why It Fits |
|---|------|------|-------------|
| 13 | **Forward Deployed Engineer, Applied AI** | Sales | Highly technical, customer-facing. Stretch on the pure engineering side, but Tony's Python/PyTorch + enterprise client skills could work. |
| 14 | **Technical Program Manager, Marketing Technology** | TPM | Bridges marketing + technology. Tony could run the systems that power Anthropic's GTM. |
| 15 | **Partner Development Manager, Build Partners** | Sales | Building the partner ecosystem. Tony's 0→1→N experience building orgs from scratch applies directly. |

## Part 2: Cold Outreach Strategy

### The Pitch (for roles that don't exist yet)

Anthropic is scaling so fast that many roles haven't been created yet. A direct message to the right senior leader — framed as *"here's a problem you have that I solve"* — can create a conversation (or even a role) that doesn't show up on the careers page.

### Who to Target

| Person/Title to Find | Why | Message Angle |
|---|---|---|
| **VP/Head of Sales** | Owns the entire revenue org; would recognize the CRO-to-AI-platform story | "I've scaled GTM orgs to $100M+. Now I've gone deep on the AI side. Happy to share what I'm seeing enterprise buyers actually need." |
| **VP/Head of Product Marketing** | Owns positioning & narrative; needs people who understand both the tech and the buyer | "Most PMMs at AI companies understand the product OR the buyer. I've done $1M+ C-level deals AND built RAG/agent systems. Here's what I think Anthropic's missing in its enterprise positioning." |
| **Head of Solutions/Applied AI** | Owns the customer-facing technical org; needs leaders who bridge sales + engineering | "I've managed both sales and engineering teams. Now I'm hands-on with PyTorch and building AI workflows. Your Applied AI org needs people who can do both." |
| **Head of Revenue Operations / GTM Strategy** | Built the GTM infrastructure | "I built RevOps and GTM infrastructure from scratch that supported 30%+ YoY ARR growth for 3 years running. At Anthropic's growth rate, that muscle matters." |

### Outreach Approach

1. **Find the right people on LinkedIn.** Look for titles like VP Sales, VP Marketing, Head of Applied AI, Head of GTM at Anthropic.
2. **Send a 3-sentence connection request** (not a novel). Example:

   > *"Hi [Name] — I'm a former CRO ($100M+ ARR, 0→1 GTM) who spent the last 3 years going deep on AI — Stanford ML/NLP/CV certs and hands-on PyTorch/RAG/agent builds. I started my career as an engineer and have managed engineering teams, so the technical depth is real. I think Anthropic's enterprise GTM is at an inflection point where my blend of experience could help. Would love 15 minutes if you're open to it."*

3. **If they accept, follow up with a slightly longer note** (max 5 sentences) that includes a specific observation about Anthropic's GTM or product that shows you've done your homework.
4. **If no response after 5 days, send ONE follow-up.** Then move on.

### Important: Don't just ask for a job — offer insight.

The best outreach doesn't say "I want a job." It says "I see a problem you have, and here's how I think about it." For example:

- "I've been watching how enterprises evaluate Claude vs. GPT-4 vs. Gemini. The #1 objection I hear from CxOs is [X]. Here's how I'd address it."
- "I built a RAG pipeline using Claude's API for enterprise FAQ use cases. The biggest gap I see in Anthropic's developer-to-enterprise pipeline is [Y]."

This positions Tony as a **peer** with insights, not a job seeker.

## Part 3: Credibility Building (Parallel Track)

### Actions to Take This Month

| Action | Effort | Impact | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. LinkedIn post: "What I learned going from CRO to AI engineer"** | Medium | High — makes the career pivot story shareable and discoverable by Anthropic employees | Week 1 |
| **2. Publish a short technical write-up** (your RAG for Enterprise FAQs project) on your site or LinkedIn | Medium | High — proves the technical chops aren't just credentials | Week 2 |
| **3. Engage with Anthropic content** — comment thoughtfully on posts by Anthropic leaders, share Claude-related insights | Low | Medium — gets your name in front of the right people | Ongoing |
| **4. Update tonyarteaga.com** — fix the 404 pages (About, AI Journey) so the site tells a complete story when people check you out | Low | High — right now anyone who clicks through from LinkedIn hits dead ends | Week 1 |

## Part 5: Honest Assessment — Strengths & Risks

### What Works in Tony's Favor
- **Rare profile.** The CRO + AI-technical combination almost doesn't exist. Most candidates are one or the other. Tony is *both* — and has the engineering degree to back it up.
- **Proof of scale.** $100M+ ARR, 30%+ YoY growth, 0→1→N org building — these are real, verifiable outcomes at OceanX.
- **Genuine technical depth — and it's not new.** BS in Industrial & Systems Engineering from USC. Managed distributed SW engineering teams at Tribune Media for 10 years. Functioned as principal architect at Guthy|Renker overseeing 50+ FTEs. The Stanford AI/ML certs (4 graduate-level courses including XCS229, XCS224N, XCS231N) and 200+ pages of technical study guides are the latest chapter of a technical career, not the first.
- **Enterprise sales DNA.** $1M+ C-level deal closing. Board/PE presentations. Anthropic's enterprise push needs people who've done this.
- **Builder mentality.** 0→1→N across sales, marketing, digital, product — exactly what a hypergrowth company needs.
- **Enterprise platform experience.** Launched a PCI Level-1 compliant cloud-native commerce SaaS platform, drove AWS migrations, directed $20M+ in projects including Salesforce rollout to 600+ sellers. This is infrastructure-scale experience.
- **Strong education.** USC ISE + USC MBA — the combination of engineering and business credentials from the same rigorous program signals someone who was always dual-tracked.

### What to Watch Out For
- **"Overqualified" perception.** A former CRO applying for non-C-level roles may get filtered. Counter this by emphasizing you're looking to *build within* Anthropic, not coast on a title. Frame it as: "I'm choosing Anthropic because this is the most important company in AI right now, and I'd rather build something meaningful here than hold a title somewhere else."
- **Not a pure specialist.** Anthropic may want deep specialists (pure ML engineer, pure enterprise AE). The counter: at Anthropic's growth stage, people who can bridge functions are more valuable than siloed specialists. And your engineering background means you're not faking the technical side.
- **Career narrative clarity.** The arc needs a crisp 30-second story. Importantly, it's NOT "business guy who pivoted to AI." It's: *"I started as an engineer, spent 20 years building increasingly cross-functional roles — managing engineering teams, architecting platforms, and ultimately scaling a company to $100M+ as CRO. Then I went back to my technical roots with Stanford AI/ML and 3 years of hands-on building. I want to bring that full loop — engineering depth, business scale, and AI fluency — to the company that's defining the future of AI."*
- **Location — mitigated.** Tony is open to SF, so state this clearly on the resume and in applications to avoid being filtered.
- **3-year gap on paper.** Jan 2023 – Present shows as "AI/ML Intensive & Career Transition." While this is genuinely impressive work, some recruiters may see a gap. Counter it by framing it as a deliberate, structured investment (Stanford graduate coursework, not just self-study) and by highlighting the tangible outputs (production-ready prototypes, 200+ page technical guides, RAG systems).

## Appendix: Resume Tailoring Notes

For Anthropic applications specifically, consider these adjustments to the current resume:

1. **Reframe the summary.** The current opening ("Cross-functional leader with 20+ years...") buries the engineering background and AI depth. Consider leading with something like: "Engineer-turned-CRO with 20+ years spanning software architecture, enterprise platform delivery, and GTM leadership — now Stanford AI/ML certified and hands-on with Python/PyTorch/RAG/agents."
2. **Elevate the engineering foundation.** The BS ISE from USC and the Tribune Media engineering leadership (distributed teams, $20M+ projects, Salesforce to 600+ sellers) should be more prominent. This is your differentiator against other CROs.
3. **Reframe "AI/ML Intensive & Career Transition."** The word "transition" may read as uncertainty. Consider: "AI/ML Deep Dive — Stanford Graduate Coursework & Applied AI Engineering" to frame it as a deliberate, rigorous investment rather than a career gap.
4. **Add Anthropic-specific language.** Mention AI safety, responsible deployment, beneficial AI somewhere. Show you understand why Anthropic is different from OpenAI or Google. For the right role, reference Claude specifically.
5. **Quantify the AI work more.** "Built production-ready prototypes" is good but vague. If possible, add specifics: what the RAG system did, how many documents it processed, what the agent workflow automated, etc.
6. **Consider a "What I Bring to Anthropic" section** at the top of a tailored version — 3 bullets that directly map your experience to their needs. E.g.: "Built GTM infrastructure from 0→$100M+ ARR — Anthropic is building this now." / "Managed 50+ person engineering orgs and directed $20M+ platform projects — I speak both languages." / "Completed 4 Stanford AI/ML graduate courses and built RAG/agent systems — I understand the product, not just the market."
7. **Location.** Update the header to: "Orange County, CA · Open to SF relocation" — this eliminates any geographic filtering.

## Appendix: USC Alumni Network Angle

Tony has **two USC degrees** (BS ISE + MBA). Anthropic likely has USC alumni. This is a warm intro channel worth exploring:

- Search LinkedIn for "Anthropic" + "University of Southern California"
- Check if the USC Viterbi School of Engineering or Marshall School of Business have active alumni in AI/tech companies
- The USC Trojan Network is tight — a warm intro from an alum inside Anthropic could bypass the ATS entirely
