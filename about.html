      <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700 max-w-3xl text-lg">
        I build customer-facing teams from scratch and help them deliver real solutions to customers.
        I'm comfortable in the messy middle: unclear requirements, tight timelines, many stakeholders, and high expectations.

    <!-- 0→1 -->
    <section class="mt-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Building from 0→1 (and scaling it)</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        I've spent a lot of my career building functions that didn't exist yet -hiring the first people, defining roles, setting standards, and creating simple operating rhythms that keep delivery moving.
        At OceanX, I built Sales, Pre-Sales, Services, and Customer Success from zero and scaled the overall engine to support $100M+ ARR.

        <ul class="mt-3 space-y-2 text-slate-700 list-disc list-outside ml-4">
          <li>Hiring: wrote the first JDs, built a consistent interview loop, and made the bar explicit</li>
          <li>Delivery: defined "done" (quality, security, docs, handoff) so teams didn't argue about basics</li>
          <li>Operations: weekly engagement reviews + simple dashboards so we saw problems early</li>
          <li>Repeatability: turned early wins into playbooks, templates, and starter repos</li>
          <li>Ambiguity: kept teams focused when scope was moving and stakeholders disagreed</li>

    <!-- People Leadership -->
    <section class="mt-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">How I lead people</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        My job is to hire strong people, get them pointed at the right problems, and remove friction so they can do great work.
        At Guthy|Renker, I earned the <strong>highest manager score company-wide</strong> in the employee survey.

          <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm mt-2">
            I hire for fundamentals, good judgment, and customer instincts—not just keywords.
            I keep the loop consistent and the expectations clear.

          <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm mt-2">
            Weekly 1:1s focused on: what's blocked, what's unclear, what's next, and what support is needed.
            Career growth gets its own cadence (goals, feedback, stretch projects).

          <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm mt-2">
            Clear definition of "good": code quality, reliability, security/privacy basics, documentation, and clean handoffs.
            Lightweight process, high bar.

          <p class="text-slate-600 text-sm mt-2">
            I'll join an architecture review, help think through a tricky production issue, or step into a high-stakes customer call when it helps.

      </p>
      <div class="mt-6 bg-white rounded-xl shadow-sm border border-slate-100 p-6">
        <ul class="space-y-2 text-slate-700 list-disc list-outside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Systems thinkers</strong> — Can see the ecosystem, connect dots across functions, and know where the 20% is that drives 80% of impact</li>
          <li><strong>Simplifiers</strong> — Turn complexity into actionable steps. Break things down into logical components.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear communicators</strong> — Exchange ideas constructively, not aggressively. Open, not stubborn.</li>
          <li><strong>Fast learners</strong> — Technically adept and can get up to speed quickly in new environments</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborators</strong> — Best idea wins, regardless of seniority or volume. Data over opinions.</li>
          <li><strong>Humble</strong> — Know they don't know everything. Can be wrong. Open to other ideas.</li>
          <li><strong>Team-first ambition</strong> — Want the team to win, not just themselves</li>

    <!-- Voice of Customer -->
    <section class="mt-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Representing the customer (without letting chaos in)</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        I advocate hard for customers internally—translating their needs into product feedback, roadmap input, and process improvements.
        Field insights should shape what we build.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        But I also protect the team. If a customer is disorganized or unclear, I build the relationship that lets me push back constructively—helping them clarify their own goals and outcomes that work for both sides. That creates structure so the team can do focused work, not firefight.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Enterprise delivery: strategic + hands-on</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        I can move between exec-level conversations and the details that make projects succeed.
        I've led technical discovery, scoped and qualified work in pre-sales, and owned delivery outcomes across complex enterprise environments.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Making work repeatable</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-slate-700">
        I like turning "we figured it out once" into "we can do this reliably."
        That usually means playbooks, starter repos, integration templates, and a simple knowledge base that captures what the field learns.
      </p>

        <ul class="mt-1 space-y-2 text-slate-700 list-disc list-outside ml-4">
          <li><strong>Integration playbooks</strong> that reduced customer time-to-value and improved conversion outcomes</li>
          <li><strong>Starter templates</strong> for common implementation patterns to speed up onboarding</li>
          <li><strong>Field-to-product feedback loops</strong> that improved roadmap prioritization and reduced delivery friction</li>
          <li><strong>Documentation habit</strong>: I write so teams can move faster (and so new hires ramp quickly)</li>

        I'm drawn to Anthropic's focus on building AI that's reliable and safe.
        I've gone deep on modern AI through Stanford's graduate-level certificates and I build with these tools day-to-day.
